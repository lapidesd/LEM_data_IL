[ Description: ] *This is the third version of the dataset*. New changes in this 3rd version:

<i>1.replaces simulations where the initial condition consists of a sinusoidal channel with topographic perturbations with simulations where the initial condition consists of a sinusoidal channel without topographic perturbations. These simulations better illustrate the transformation of a nondendritic network into a dendritic one.
2. contains two additional simulations showing how total domain size affects the landscape's dynamism.
3. changes dataset title to reflect the publication's title</i>

This dataset contains data from 18 simulations using a landscape evolution model. A landscape evolution model simulates how uplift and rock incision shape the Earth's (or other planets) surface. To date, most landscape evolution models exhibit "extreme memory" (paper: https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL083305 and dataset: https://doi.org/10.13012/B2IDB-4484338_V1). Extreme memory in landscape evolution models causes initial conditions to be unrealistically preserved.

This dataset contains simulations from a new landscape evolution model that incorporates a sub-model that allows bedrock channels to erode laterally. With this addition, the landscapes no longer exhibit extreme memory. Initial conditions are erased over time, and the landscapes tend towards a dynamic steady state instead of a static one. The model with lateral erosion is named LEM-wLE (Landscape Evolution Model with Lateral Erosion) and the model without lateral erosion is named LEM-woLE (Landscape Evolution Model without Lateral Erosion).

There are 16 folders in total. Here are the descriptions:

<i>>LEM-woLE_simulations:</i> This folder contains simulations using LEM-woLE. Inside the folder are 5 subfolders containing 100 elevation rasters, 100 drainage area rasters, and 100 plots showing the slope-area relationship. Elevation depicts the height of the landscape, and drainage area represents a contributing area that is upslope. Each folder corresponds to a different initial condition. Driver files and code for these simulations can be found at https://github.com/jeffskwang/LEM-wLE.

<i>>MOVIE_S#_data:</i> There are 13  data folders that contain raster data for 13 simulations using LEM-wLE. Inside each folder are 1000 elevation rasters, 1000 drainage area rasters, and 1000 plots showing the slope-area relationship. Driver files and code for these simulations can be found at https://github.com/jeffskwang/LEM-wLE.

<i>>movies_mp4_format:</i> For each data folder there are 3 movies generated that show elevation (a), drainage area (b), and erosion rates (c). These files are formatted in the mp4 format and are best viewed using VLC media player (https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html).

<i>>movies_wmv_format:</i> This folder contains the same movies as the "movies_mp4_format" folder, but they are in a wmv format. These movies can be viewed using Windows media player or other Windows platform movie software.
